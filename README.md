Although electrophysiologists have been routinely recording intracellular neural activity ever since the groundbreaking work of Hodgkin and Huxley, and extracellular multi-channel electrodes are also frequently and extensively used, a practical experimental method to track multiple intracellular membrane potential changes along a complete single neuron is still lacking.

Instead of obtaining multiple intracellular measurement on the same neuron, we propose an alternative method by **combining single-channel somatic patch-clamp** and **multi-channel extracellular potential recordings**. We show that it is possible to reconstruct the **complete spatio-temporal distribution of the intracellular membrane potential** of a single neuron with a spatial resolution of the extracellular probe during action potential generation.

Moreover, the reconstruction of membrane potential allows for distinguishing between the two major, but previously hidden components of the current source density (CSD) distribution: the **resistive** and the **capacitive current**. This distinction provides a clue to the clear interpretation of the CSD analysis, as the resistive component corresponds to the active ion channel currents, (both synaptic and voltage-sensitive channel currents), while the capacitive currents correspond to passive counter currents.

We validate our model-based reconstruction approach on **simulations** and demonstrate its application to experimental data using **paired extracellular and intracellular **recordings from a single pyramidal cell of the rat hippocampus, in vitro.

In perspective, the estimation of the spatial distribution of resistive membrane currents makes possible the **distinction between active and passive sinks and sources** of the CSD map and the **localization of the synaptic input currents**, which make the neuron fire.
